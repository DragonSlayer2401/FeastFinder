This document contains general notes related to...

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - design mistakes
Brief overview of research. 

* You should be able to look at a page and immediately know where to start reading.
* Have consistent alignment on content.
* Use good color combinations.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 2 - API design
Brief overview of research. 

* Keep API routes simple 
* Use nouns instead of verbs in api routes because HTTP methods are the verbs
* Query parameters should be used instead of route names so it should be /products?name="ABC" and not /getByProductName.
