# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your Tech Stack information. List the tools and technology you would like to use for your final project. Explain your reasoning for this as well. For example, how does the proposed tool or technology provide value to your overall portfolio of work? 


## Application Design

What tool(s) will you use to create click-through designs of the application? List any UI kits you would like to utilize as well. 

Bootstrap-react
TailwindCSS



## Front End Framework

List your approach for front end development. For example, React is an often used front-end solution for projects in addition to using moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.   

Vite React


## State Management

What is your proposed solution for managing data? This could mean utilizing a database, local-storage, and in general state management libraries for the application (e.g. Redux).    

MongoDB for long term storage like user data
React State for short term storage like user input 
Local Storage or Cookies for medium term storage like JWTs


## Node

Node is often used to serve both an API and to render a front-end. This includes using best practices, npm, and npx. What do you propose? 

Node will be used only for setting up Vite React, installing packages, and backend development like running the server. 


## Express

Express is a popular framework to power an API. Describe your idea for building similar functionality offered by express: e.g. middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

I will be using Express to build my backend API. It will be used for all backend routes, controllers, and middleware that I utilize. I have never tried to build Express functionality without Express in JavaScript. But I want to say that JavaScript has an http thing built in that you can use for routes. In other programming languages like C# they have DotNet which can handle routes and controllers with classes.


## SQL/Postgres/Sequelize

A popular solution for relational database work is to utilize Sequelize as an ORM. Are you familiar with migrations, models, and seeding? What tools and solutions do you propose for your application? For example, utilizing an ORM to build out models with full validated CRUD.

I will most likely use mongoose with MongoDB to simplify writing mongo queries and creating mongo schemas. I'm not super familar with SQL migrations, models, and seeding but have heard of the terms and did learn a little bit of SQL in the past.
