# Change Order

I will be creating a food recipe searching app using a MERN tech stack along with the Spoonacular API. I will also use CSS frameworks like React Bootstrap and Tailwind to help code the user interface. The app will allow favoriting recipes for easier access via a favorites page and will also use JWTs to keep users logged into their account after they leave the page. The Spoonacular API will be called on the backend for security purposes. Most of the frontend at this point is done so in the next 4 weeks the project should be complete. I would say the project is anywhere from 40% to 50% complete at the moment.
